User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

Welcome to www.silverheath.co.uk.

This is my first website and my submission for the User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project. 
Part of the Full Stack Development course with the Code Institute. 

Website designed and coded by Mark Dyson.

The idea for the site is to provide a personal profile giving me an online presence with the aim of finding future coding work.

The site is available to view at www.silverheath.co.uk

I have used AWS to code and store the data. 

I have pushed the site data out to my Github repository.  

I was making regular push requests during the process to keep a good history flow and backup.
After completing the site, I purchased the domain from Google domains. 

Then I purchased the hosting from www.siteground.com. 

Following the purchase, I used Google domains web portal and pointed the DNS details to the new housing companyâ€™s servers. 

Utilising sitegrounds excellent web portals I created my own email accounts. 
Then I uploaded the website files and folders to make the site go live. 

I have used HTML and CSS to create the site. 

In addition, I have used code from Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Hover CSS.

The CV.pdf was created through the latest version of Microsoft Word. 

Please feel free to send me constructive feedback to mark@silverheath.co.uk
